TODO:
----------------------
  - Contacts page:
      - links to www.dunmire.org
      - links to rockgdlabs
      - an email address myhikes@dunmire.org (maybe it should be
        mytrails since I have more than hikes in the list)

  - added a type column to the track list

  - hide description for track in hero unit if it is not available and
    change the size of the map to fill the hero unit

  - I'm not happy with the information in the hero box, the description
    is too detailed and there is too much info. Really need just a
    teaser...

  - put cursor information (elev, dist, etc.) in a floating bubble
    attached to the point on the map.

  - In the track stats area, make elev min and max links that put a
    mark on the map for the high and low points. Or maybe put it in as a
    'Location' link.

  - allow zoom on elevation chart

  - relocate to dunmire.org

  - links to/from RockingdLabs.dunmire.org
  
  - Allow multiple tracks

  - extract more data from the KML file

  - make KML handling specific to the newer MyTracks format
     - add time info:
     - scale distances to match - DONE by python preprocessing
       Multiply each distance by the ratio of the total distance
       calculated divided by the MyTracks reported distance.

  Still need to solve how to organize several hundred hikes, each
  requiring 3 files...
    - by date for sure, need sort and filter option
    - by location would be great
    - some tag that would group the tracks

  Trying to install basemap toolkit for matplotlib.
    See http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Maps
    There are problems due to versions of libgeos, the libgeos-dev
    package can not be installed. So while I think this is a possible
    approach to generating the thumbnails I want, I don't feel like
    pursing it on this old Ubuntu version (10.10).
    

DONE
----------------------
  - Need an index of tracks
     - drop down?
     - separate page?
     - one of the panels? - DONE on home page
     - a thumbnail graphic of the track would be useful - DONE
     - add lat/lon of the start of the track as alt text for the
       thumbnail. Then enable sorting for the thumbnails and use a
       custom sort to sort using lat/lon. - DONE
     - put in 10 rows and then use the table pager

  - tablesorter filter and pager don't work together, so which shall I
    use on the first page? If it is the pager, then perhaps an 'index'
    page should be added that lists all the tracks and uses the filter
    widget.
      - Setup a search/page option, turning on the search option would
        turn off the page option and vis-a-versa - DONE

  - fix hero map- it should also link to the map page. 

  - get latest version of tablesorter
     https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter

  - fix sorting problem on table load

  - Idea for list display:
      Thumbnail of track, name, distance, date
      Use twitter bootstrap striped and condensed tables with the jQuery
      table sorter and table pager plugins.
      js libraries have been downloaded to myHikes/jquery-tablesorter from
      http://tablesorter.com/docs/

  - Idea for home page:
      Big area at top (forgot what facebook framework calls it) would have
      a small map and the summary from the most recent hike.

      Columns underneath would have a list of other hikes (by date?)

      Get the list of hikes from a php script, perhaps in a JSON format

  - generalize home location and remove marker for privacy reasons.

  - Parse window.location.href to get the track name to load. This makes
    it possible to have one .html file and many track(.kml,.json) files

  - Parse window.locaton.href to decode Permalink arguments.

  - Add license (CC-BY-..) in footer

  - Added attributions in footer

  - add other tile sources, particularly arial tile from Mapquest

  - problem with new version of MyTracks KML file- it uses gx:coord and
    the track therefore does not show up. FIXED: New option to
    addTrackLayer: ttype:
       ttype = linestring : track is in a <LineString> stanza
       ttype = gx:track   : track is in a <gx:Track> stanza

  - For myTracks generated kml, one of the <Placemark> sections includes
    a <description> with a number summary values. Also there is a
    document title. Parse and add the information to the web page.
    Better still, make it an active link and pop-up on the map. Click
    on the marker and a bubble pops up with the Placemark info.
    This is problematic for new MyTracks KML files because the KML
    parser for with the extractTracks setting does not return the
    Placemarks that do not include <gx:track> entries.
    DONE- used python to extract the description into a .txt file.

  - progress bar -DONE

  - get under revision control - DONE, git

  - add link to Credits, which should be on the About page

  - About page:
      - links to the tools, jquery, html5boiler plate, bootstrap, tablesorter,
        myTracks Openstreetmaps, Thunderforest, mapquest, openlayers

      - Explain why this site exists
         this is a way for me to try out modern web site design tools
         I wanted to easily view myTracks and google maps wasn't doing
         it for me.

   - Planning page:
      - links to trail descriptions
      - links to pedometer

  - Get the top-bar navigation links working

  - Need an About page

  - Links to hike planning/trail sites

  - add a last modified date to pages
