TODO:
----------------------
  - put cursor information (elev, dist, etc.) in a floating bubble
    attached to the point on the map.

  - In the track stats area, make elev min and max links that put a
    mark on the map for the high and low points. Or maybe put it in as a
    'Location' link.

  - Get the top-bar navigation links working

  - allow zoom on elevation chart

  - relocate to dunmire.org

  - links to/from RockingdLabs.dunmire.org
  
  - get under revision control

  - Allow multiple tracks

  - extract more data from the KML file

  - make KML handling specific to the newer MyTracks format
     - add time info:
     - scale distances to match - DONE by python preprocessing
       Multiply each distance by the ratio of the total distance
       calculated divided by the MyTracks reported distance.

  - Need an index of tracks
     - drop down?
     - separate page?
     - one of the panels?
     - a thumbnail graphic of the track would be useful

  - Need an About page

  - Links to hike planning/trail sites

DONE
----------------------
  - generalize home location and remove marker for privacy reasons.

  - Parse window.location.href to get the track name to load. This makes
    it possible to have one .html file and many track(.kml,.json) files

  - Parse window.locaton.href to decode Permalink arguments.

  - Add license (CC-BY-..) in footer

  - Added attributions in footer

  - add other tile sources, particularly arial tile from Mapquest

  - problem with new version of MyTracks KML file- it uses gx:coord and
    the track therefore does not show up. FIXED: New option to
    addTrackLayer: ttype:
       ttype = linestring : track is in a <LineString> stanza
       ttype = gx:track   : track is in a <gx:Track> stanza

  - For myTracks generated kml, one of the <Placemark> sections includes
    a <description> with a number summary values. Also there is a
    document title. Parse and add the information to the web page.
    Better still, make it an active link and pop-up on the map. Click
    on the marker and a bubble pops up with the Placemark info.
    This is problematic for new MyTracks KML files because the KML
    parser for with the extractTracks setting does not return the
    Placemarks that do not include <gx:track> entries.
    DONE- used python to extract the description into a .txt file.

  - progress bar -DONE
