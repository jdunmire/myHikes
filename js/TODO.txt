TODO:
----------------------
  - I don't like the way I had to change all of the hero-unit p styles
    to get a small font for the track details. See line 28 of style.css.
    I need to look into how to nest the styles.
    UPDATE- I think it is working now, but only through trial and error.
            Still need to look closer.

  - I'm not happy with the information in the hero box, the description
    is too detailed and there is too much info. Really need just a
    teaser...

  - put cursor information (elev, dist, etc.) in a floating bubble
    attached to the point on the map.

  - In the track stats area, make elev min and max links that put a
    mark on the map for the high and low points. Or maybe put it in as a
    'Location' link.

  - Get the top-bar navigation links working

  - allow zoom on elevation chart

  - relocate to dunmire.org

  - links to/from RockingdLabs.dunmire.org
  
  - Allow multiple tracks

  - extract more data from the KML file

  - make KML handling specific to the newer MyTracks format
     - add time info:
     - scale distances to match - DONE by python preprocessing
       Multiply each distance by the ratio of the total distance
       calculated divided by the MyTracks reported distance.

  - Need an index of tracks
     - drop down?
     - separate page?
     - one of the panels?
     - a thumbnail graphic of the track would be useful

  - Need an About page

  - Links to hike planning/trail sites

  Idea for home page:
    Big area at top (forgot what facebook framework calls it) would have
    a small map and the summary from the most recent hike.

    Columns underneath would have a list of other hikes (by date?)

    Get the list of hikes from a php script, perhaps in a JSON format


  Still need to solve how to organize several hundred hikes, each
  requiring 3 files...
    - by date for sure, need sort and filter option
    - by location would be great
    - some tag that would group the tracks

  Idea for list display:
    Thumbnail of track, name, distance, date
    Use twitter bootstrap striped and condensed tables with the jQuery
    table sorter and table pager plugins.
    js libraries have been downloaded to myHikes/jquery-tablesorter from
    http://tablesorter.com/docs/

  Trying to install basemap toolkit for matplotlib.
    See http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Maps
    There are problems due to versions of libgeos, the libgeos-dev
    package can not be installed. So while I think this is a possible
    approach to generating the thumbnails I want, I don't feel like
    pursing it on this old Ubuntu version (10.10).
    
DONE
----------------------
  - generalize home location and remove marker for privacy reasons.

  - Parse window.location.href to get the track name to load. This makes
    it possible to have one .html file and many track(.kml,.json) files

  - Parse window.locaton.href to decode Permalink arguments.

  - Add license (CC-BY-..) in footer

  - Added attributions in footer

  - add other tile sources, particularly arial tile from Mapquest

  - problem with new version of MyTracks KML file- it uses gx:coord and
    the track therefore does not show up. FIXED: New option to
    addTrackLayer: ttype:
       ttype = linestring : track is in a <LineString> stanza
       ttype = gx:track   : track is in a <gx:Track> stanza

  - For myTracks generated kml, one of the <Placemark> sections includes
    a <description> with a number summary values. Also there is a
    document title. Parse and add the information to the web page.
    Better still, make it an active link and pop-up on the map. Click
    on the marker and a bubble pops up with the Placemark info.
    This is problematic for new MyTracks KML files because the KML
    parser for with the extractTracks setting does not return the
    Placemarks that do not include <gx:track> entries.
    DONE- used python to extract the description into a .txt file.

  - progress bar -DONE

  - get under revision control - DONE, git
